# link_shield_protection
Link Shield Pro is a modern URL safety checker that combines heuristic analysis, deterministic reputation, and sandboxed previews to help you browse safely.

⚠️ Demo / Experimental tool — not a replacement for full malware protection.

🚀 Features

URL Safety Check – Detect if a link is safe, suspicious, or dangerous.
Heuristic Analysis – Looks for punycode, long URLs, phishing keywords, and insecure protocols.
Deterministic Verdicts – Same URL always gives the same result.
Sandbox Preview – Open links safely in an iframe; choose Strict or Permissive mode.
Cached Results – Saves analysis in your browser for faster repeated checks.
Responsive & Modern UI – Works beautifully on desktop and mobile.
⚡ How to Use

Open index.html in your browser.
Paste the URL you want to analyze.
Click Analyze to see the verdict:
✅ Safe – Open normally or in sandbox.
⚠️ Warning – Use sandbox to stay safe.
❌ Danger – Use strict sandbox or analyze further.
Sandbox will auto-close after 60 seconds.
🛠 Sandbox Options

Strict Mode – Blocks scripts, forms, and popups.
Permissive Mode – Allows scripts and interaction.
Auto-close Timer – Sandbox closes automatically to prevent risks.
